## Overview
This project analyzes movie datasets for Microsoft, a multinational technology company known for developing software, hardware and cloud-based services. Microsoft has been a trendsetter in technology for nearly half a century. We are renowned for our innovation, commitment to quality and global impact on the digital landscape. From operating systems to cloud computing, our expertise has touched every corner of the tech universe. In an era where technology and entertainment intersect to define the boundaries of creativity and engagement, Microsoft is embarking on a remarkable journey. Our focus is to establish a great presence in the world of original video content creation. We leverage the power of data to derive insights that will provide a path forward for Microsoftâ€™s new movie studio.
## Business Problem
Original video content creation has emerged as a cultural and economic force globally. Microsoft recognizes the potential of this domain and that is why we are charting a course into the world of entertainment. Microsoft have decided to create a new movie studio. My task is to explore the films that are performing best at the Box Office. I then use these findings to generate valuable insights that the head of the new movie studio can use to decide which type of films to create. My aim is to equip the new studio with the knowledge and strategies it needs to thrive in the competitive entertainment industry.
## Data
The data contains movie datasets from Box Office Mojo, IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, TheMovieDB and The Numbers. The data files provide details about the movie titles, release year, runtime, genres, production budget, languages as well as several other attributes of the movies.

## Conclusions
This analysis led to three recommendations for Microsoft to consider when getting into the movie business:

- **Allocate sufficient resources to production budgets.** Investing in production is important in order to maximize returns from the films. Producing high-quality content plays a significant role in the success of the movies.
  
- **Consider seasonal strategy.** Given that movies released during Summer tend to have a higher average worldwide gross, consider allocating more resources towards the Summer season when the audiences are more active and engaged.

- **Diversity in runtimes.** Consider producing a mix of short, medium, and long films to cater to various target audiences. This allows for broader audience appeal and accommodates different viewer preferences.
  
## Next Steps

Further analyses that could yield additional insights in order to make an informed decision:

- **Analyze how genre can affect the performance of the movies.** Investigate whether there are differences in reception across the genres and how this affects box office performance.Are there emerging genres gaining popularity?

- **Predicting audience engagement.** This model could analyze social media trends, audience sentiment and audience discussions to predict the level of audience engagement and interest in a movie before its release.
  
- **Market research.** Identify trends, emerging opportunities and audience demographics to understand the state of the movie industry. Analyze the competition to find key players and gaps that the business can fill.
